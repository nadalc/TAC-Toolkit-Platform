# TAC Toolkit Platform

## [ENG]

# Introduction
This project is the implementation of an existing design tool: the TAC toolkit.
It was divided into three parts:
The TAC cards which groups together a set of cards representing the stages of acceptance.
The personas that allow designers (stakeholders) to have access to archetypes of individuals, and their scenarios.
The Storyboard is a role-playing board (1 user, 2 designers). This board allows for each step in f the user (the persona)’s journey to reflect on the factors influencing user acceptance (through the TAC cards).
The idea is to create a software: TAC Toolkit platform (also called “TAC Toolkit system”)
