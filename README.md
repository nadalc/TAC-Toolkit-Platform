# TAC Think-Space

## [ENG]

# Introduction
This project is the implementation of the Think-Space associated with the Technology Acceptance (TAC) Toolkit.
It was divided into three parts:
*The TAC cards which groups together a set of cards representing the stages of acceptance.
*The personas that allow designers (stakeholders) to have access to archetypes of individuals, and their scenarios.
*The Storyboard is a role-playing board (1 user, 2 designers). This board allows for each step in f the user (the persona)â€™s journey to reflect on the factors influencing user acceptance (through the TAC cards).

### How to modify scenario and set of cards
#### modify scenario
To modify the scenario you will have to access the tabletop script.

Then change the code from line 29.

#### add a set of cards
To add a set of cards, you will have to create a new folder.
In this folder add a folder for each card named "card_x" (x is the id of the card).
In each folder "card_x", add a .png for each type (deck, card, card_valid and information).

Take care when you change assets, they might don't look correctly.
You will have to check for each Sprite, if the region is disabled.
